# Hand-Gesture-Recognisation-skillCraft
# 🤖 Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

## 📘 Overview
This project is developed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship (Task 4)** at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The model identifies hand gestures representing A–Z alphabets (ASL), including 'Space' and 'Nothing'.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand gestures.
- Use image augmentation to improve accuracy on a small dataset.
- Visualize training progress and model performance.

---

## 🧩 Steps Implemented
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
2. Data Augmentation
3. CNN Model Design
4. Model Training & Validation
5. Evaluation & Visualization
6. Business Impact Analysis

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV  

---

## 📈 Results
- Model Accuracy: ~85–90% (with augmented data)
- Saved Model: `hand_gesture_recognition_model.h5`

---

## 💡 Business Impact
This model can power **gesture-based systems** for:
- Sign Language Translation 👐  
- Touchless Controls 🤖  
- Human–Computer Interaction 💻
